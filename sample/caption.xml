start="5.16" dur="3.28">I was going to have to quit programming</text><text start="6.6" dur="3.8">because my wrists were hurting so I</text><text start="8.44" dur="4.04">learned Dvorak a custom one that I made</text><text start="10.4" dur="3.8">in hopes to save my wrists but then my</text><text start="12.48" dur="3.84">coworker told me to try the Kinesis</text><text start="14.2" dur="5.2">Advantage 2 and I did and it changed the</text><text start="16.32" dur="6.08">course of my life I could program again</text><text start="19.4" dur="4.84">I used the glove 80 for 100 hours and</text><text start="22.4" dur="3.639">this is my opinion of it during those</text><text start="24.24" dur="4.4">100 hours I was able to successfully</text><text start="26.039" dur="4.441">launch a terminal only coffee shop in</text><text start="28.64" dur="6.16">which we got to the top of hacker news</text><text start="30.48" dur="7.2">made a sweet coffee asy particle effect</text><text start="34.8" dur="6.68">and that&amp;#39;s right 1,000 people playing</text><text start="37.68" dur="5.76">mind sweeper on Twitch live so I had a</text><text start="41.48" dur="4.239">decent amount of usage over those 100</text><text start="43.44" dur="4.36">hours and even had a pretty decent words</text><text start="45.719" dur="3.561">per minute on monkey type so I have a</text><text start="47.8" dur="3.84">lot of positive things to say about the</text><text start="49.28" dur="4.68">glove 80 but I also have some negative</text><text start="51.64" dur="4.599">things to say as with any dactyl style</text><text start="53.96" dur="3.64">keyboard it tends to cost a little bit</text><text start="56.239" dur="4">more than your standard keyboard</text><text start="57.6" dur="4.52">specifically the glove 80 runs at $400</text><text start="60.239" dur="3.721">but you also get this amazing travel</text><text start="62.12" dur="3.88">case this travel case is quite</text><text start="63.96" dur="4.96">impressive I really really liked the</text><text start="66" dur="4.479">feel of it honestly this is such a huge</text><text start="68.92" dur="3">bonus and look at that look how nicely</text><text start="70.479" dur="3.201">they&amp;#39;re packed you know you&amp;#39;re going to</text><text start="71.92" dur="4.12">be able to travel and not ruin your</text><text start="73.68" dur="4.079">keyboard absolutely love that the</text><text start="76.04" dur="4.119">strongest quality I personally think</text><text start="77.759" dur="5">about the glove 80 is the software the</text><text start="80.159" dur="5.721">Bluetooth never disconnected I used it</text><text start="82.759" dur="5.761">all 100 hours never experienced a single</text><text start="85.88" dur="4.64">connectivity issue now when I was using</text><text start="88.52" dur="5.08">the Kinesis I would experience at least</text><text start="90.52" dur="5.599">one per day definitely outshines any</text><text start="93.6" dur="5.08">other keyboard I&amp;#39;ve ever used absolutely</text><text start="96.119" dur="5.96">wonderful also to flash a custom layout</text><text start="98.68" dur="6">is so dang simple with the glove 80</text><text start="102.079" dur="4.481">website you actually have like a v/v</text><text start="104.68" dur="4.52">type editor where you can put in your</text><text start="106.56" dur="5.519">own remaps and it will just do it for</text><text start="109.2" dur="5.72">you super simple and super impressive</text><text start="112.079" dur="5.08">the keyboard itself is very beautiful I</text><text start="114.92" dur="4.6">absolutely love it but I I do want to</text><text start="117.159" dur="6.521">say one thing it has RGB but the reality</text><text start="119.52" dur="5.84">is I don&amp;#39;t even look at my keyboard okay</text><text start="123.68" dur="4.48">I don&amp;#39;t think about it I don&amp;#39;t look</text><text start="125.36" dur="5.399">about it I just use it to type so those</text><text start="128.16" dur="4.36">kind of features are meaningless for me</text><text start="130.759" dur="4.321">but when it comes to the shape of the</text><text start="132.52" dur="4.32">keyboard it does feel really good it</text><text start="135.08" dur="4.48">feels just like the same thing I&amp;#39;ve had</text><text start="136.84" dur="5.32">with a Dactyl style keyboard and with a</text><text start="139.56" dur="4.6">Kinesis keyboard it just feels right the</text><text start="142.16" dur="4.68">hand fits right in there the keys feel</text><text start="144.16" dur="4.56">nice and smooth absolutely loved the</text><text start="146.84" dur="3.759">shape of this including this kind of</text><text start="148.72" dur="3.64">layout this manuform lay out really</text><text start="150.599" dur="3.64">really nice I couldn&amp;#39;t actually really</text><text start="152.36" dur="4.959">tell a difference with my thumbs between</text><text start="154.239" dur="4.881">the Kinesis and the glove 80 it just</text><text start="157.319" dur="4.92">felt pretty natural now this is where</text><text start="159.12" dur="5.96">things get a bit more negative the feel</text><text start="162.239" dur="5.761">is a bit fragile when I push on the</text><text start="165.08" dur="5.72">keyboard it just flexes it feels really</text><text start="168" dur="4.959">light it feels like I could break it and</text><text start="170.8" dur="4.96">I don&amp;#39;t really like that now I want to</text><text start="172.959" dur="4.961">emphasize it doesn&amp;#39;t feel cheap it feels</text><text start="175.76" dur="4.32">fragile and now we&amp;#39;re going to get a bit</text><text start="177.92" dur="4.92">more negative but this negative might</text><text start="180.08" dur="4.879">just be for me only I really did not</text><text start="182.84" dur="4.959">like how big the key caps were because</text><text start="184.959" dur="4.521">it caused this really close in proximity</text><text start="187.799" dur="4.121">key cap kind of configuration which</text><text start="189.48" dur="4.039">means that I would accidentally type two</text><text start="191.92" dur="3.84">keys at the same time and I just find</text><text start="193.519" dur="4.72">myself not doing that on the Kinesis</text><text start="195.76" dur="4.759">because there&amp;#39;s enough space betwix the</text><text start="198.239" dur="4.28">key caps that if I slightly fat finger</text><text start="200.519" dur="4.041">something I&amp;#39;m not going to dual press</text><text start="202.519" dur="3.64">keys down and I really don&amp;#39;t think that</text><text start="204.56" dur="3.319">this is just like a some slight</text><text start="206.159" dur="4">difference in shape and I just never got</text><text start="207.879" dur="3.92">used to it in a 100 hours I probably</text><text start="210.159" dur="4.28">should have gotten used to it I just</text><text start="211.799" dur="4.321">could never seem to get used to it now I</text><text start="214.439" dur="4">know a lot of you like to have a lot of</text><text start="216.12" dur="3.839">raised or tilting to your keyboard I</text><text start="218.439" dur="3.08">personally have never really liked that</text><text start="219.959" dur="3.2">it&amp;#39;s just my hands don&amp;#39;t really rest</text><text start="221.519" dur="3.161">that way but with the glove 80 you</text><text start="223.159" dur="3.16">certainly can raise it there&amp;#39;s these</text><text start="224.68" dur="3.24">little screws you have to unscrew and</text><text start="226.319" dur="4.081">you&amp;#39;re going to adjust them all to be</text><text start="227.92" dur="3.84">the exact correct height and if you do</text><text start="230.4" dur="3">that you&amp;#39;ll be able to kind of have it</text><text start="231.76" dur="3.6">at any level you want and there are</text><text start="233.4" dur="4.759">extension ones so you can kind of tilt</text><text start="235.36" dur="4.799">it to your heart&amp;#39;s desire me personally</text><text start="238.159" dur="4.201">I just don&amp;#39;t really use that feature</text><text start="240.159" dur="4.201">either on the Kinesis or on the glove 80</text><text start="242.36" dur="3.879">but I will say I do prefer the Kinesis</text><text start="244.36" dur="4.519">in this case because just having those</text><text start="246.239" dur="5">locking steps is just a lot easier than</text><text start="248.879" dur="3.881">trying to perfectly get the adjustment</text><text start="251.239" dur="3.64">but if you really want to be able to</text><text start="252.76" dur="3.599">find grain control the glove 80 would</text><text start="254.879" dur="3.521">just simply be better cuz you can have</text><text start="256.359" dur="4.481">it at any height you want all right so</text><text start="258.4" dur="4.92">now for the biggest problem of mine when</text><text start="260.84" dur="4.48">it comes to the glove 80 I could not</text><text start="263.32" dur="4.159">seem to get this keyboard to stay in</text><text start="265.32" dur="4.04">place I used it on several different</text><text start="267.479" dur="4.361">surfaces especially when I hit like a</text><text start="269.36" dur="4.92">six or a seven I would shift the</text><text start="271.84" dur="4.24">keyboard over a couple millimeters and</text><text start="274.28" dur="4">over the course of just a minute or two</text><text start="276.08" dur="3.679">of typing I will simply move the</text><text start="278.28" dur="4.04">keyboard all over the place and I have</text><text start="279.759" dur="4.201">to constantly adjust the keyboard as you</text><text start="282.32" dur="3.68">can see here this video that is playing</text><text start="283.96" dur="4.079">quickly that&amp;#39;s just 10 minutes of me</text><text start="286" dur="4.56">typing and I readjusted the keyboards</text><text start="288.039" dur="5.081">what six seven times in fact when I</text><text start="290.56" dur="5.079">launched the coffee company you can see</text><text start="293.12" dur="4.96">if you zoom in on the video I literally</text><text start="295.639" dur="4.161">taped the keyboard to the table with</text><text start="298.08" dur="3.64">double-sided tape to prevent it from</text><text start="299.8" dur="4.56">moving outside so though the keyboard is</text><text start="301.72" dur="4.319">very portable depending on the surface</text><text start="304.36" dur="4">you may have a lot of trouble with it</text><text start="306.039" dur="4.16">moving around for me this keyboard</text><text start="308.36" dur="4">generally was a negative experience</text><text start="310.199" dur="4.641">between the key caps being so close</text><text start="312.36" dur="5.119">together and the slight shifting I would</text><text start="314.84" dur="4.6">just miss type all the time I don&amp;#39;t want</text><text start="317.479" dur="3.761">to tape down my keyboard I don&amp;#39;t want to</text><text start="319.44" dur="4.319">screw it in my table I just want to be</text><text start="321.24" dur="4.2">able to set it and have it work but if</text><text start="323.759" dur="3.841">that really isn&amp;#39;t your problem this</text><text start="325.44" dur="3.96">keyboard is pretty dang awesome the</text><text start="327.6" dur="3.2">software again is out of this world and</text><text start="329.4" dur="2.88">for there&amp;#39;s really three important</text><text start="330.8" dur="3.2">things you need to look for when it</text><text start="332.28" dur="3.479">comes to a keyboard number one thumb</text><text start="334" dur="4.12">clusters that&amp;#39;s just going to prevent a</text><text start="335.759" dur="4.641">whole bunch of tilting in your hands</text><text start="338.12" dur="4.68">that is just absolutely important number</text><text start="340.4" dur="4.28">two concavity that concavity is just</text><text start="342.8" dur="3.2">much more natural with your hands and</text><text start="344.68" dur="4">you&amp;#39;re going to find yourself just</text><text start="346" dur="4.68">stretching less and lastly split you</text><text start="348.68" dur="4.12">need to be able to adjust the keyboard</text><text start="350.68" dur="3.44">to your width of your shoulders because</text><text start="352.8" dur="2.839">every shoulder is going to be slightly</text><text start="354.12" dur="3.6">different you don&amp;#39;t want to be hunched</text><text start="355.639" dur="4.481">over you don&amp;#39;t want to be too far out</text><text start="357.72" dur="4.52">you want that nice neutral middle ground</text><text start="360.12" dur="4.639">and yes I do put concavity more</text><text start="362.24" dur="5.079">important than split the reality is is</text><text start="364.759" dur="7.321">this keyboard right here saved my career</text><text start="367.319" dur="7.16">in 2015 so I am just so dang grateful</text><text start="372.08" dur="4.679">for it and if you&amp;#39;re experiencing pain</text><text start="374.479" dur="5.801">I&amp;#39;d highly recommend it whether you go</text><text start="376.759" dur="5.88">with a glove 80 a Kinesis some 3D</text><text start="380.28" dur="4.44">printed built dactyl keyboard just get</text><text start="382.639" dur="4.081">anything it&amp;#39;s totally worth it

dur="5.961">pain you just gained a new life skill</text><text start="391.639" dur="6.28">pain forever don&amp;#39;t start when you have</text><text start="394.72" dur="4.56">problems invest in the ergonomics early</text><text start="397.919" dur="4.4">and I did want to do like a quick</text><text start="399.28" dur="5.28">disclosure here one I am not being paid</text><text start="402.319" dur="4.921">to talk about this keyboard glove 80</text><text start="404.56" dur="4.56">will not have a single QR code coupon</text><text start="407.24" dur="4.04">code or anything like that from this</text><text start="409.12" dur="4.639">video for me to earn money off of and</text><text start="411.28" dur="4.08">number two I am technically paid by</text><text start="413.759" dur="3.521">Kinesis I&amp;#39;ve been paid in the past and</text><text start="415.36" dur="3.839">I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;ll be paid in the future by</text><text start="417.28" dur="3.24">Kinesis to rep their keyboards and so</text><text start="419.199" dur="3.84">that&amp;#39;s important when taking in the</text><text start="420.52" dur="4.28">words I&amp;#39;ve said about the glove 80 you</text><text start="423.039" dur="5">may find that I have a biased opinion</text><text start="424.8" dur="7.239">and the reality is I probably do the</text><text start="428.039" dur="4">name is the
